## User Experience (UX)

I wanted to create a fun game that enriches the players' vocabulary and stimulates their intellect.

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to make it interesting enough for possible future users.
* I want the game to be responsive for different device sizes.
* I want the game to be easy to use.

#### Returning and frequent Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to see updates (news page) about Kiki's fulfillments.

### Colour Scheme

As the game expects the user to reflect and come up with the correct word, I wanted to keep the colour scheme coherent and straightforward so as to not overwhelm users. 
* I have used `#C44739` & `#43A579` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used `#FFEDD4` as the overlay for the background.
* I have used `#FAD7A7` for the main game area.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen font for use in the site.

I have used the google font [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins). The reasons I chose this one is:
* Readability on screens of all sizes.
* Versatility with a variety of weights and styles.
* Aesthetic appeal with a modern and elegant design.
* Multilingual support for diverse audiences.
* Web optimization for consistent rendering across browsers.
* Accessibility compliance for improved readability for all users.


### Imagery

As the website is about finding the correct behind, I wanted to implement some modals when the player succeeds or not. It makes it funny and even when the player fails to find the word, they're give a "Try again" message.

### Wireframes

I started sketchin by hand to get an initial understanding of the device sizes in relation to what I wanted to show. 
Then I used balsamiq to make it more concrete and structured.

### Features

The website is comprised of just one page.
The page is responsive and has:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

![favicon](documentation/readme/lv_favicon.png)

* A header at the top of the page. 
![The Logos Vertex header](documentation/readme/lv_header.png)

* A footer at the bottom of the page.

#### Main Page

The main page of Logos Vertex displays the site's name as a header and then there's a main game area separated from the background.

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Add a function that shows how many points the user has collected.
2. Add a function that gives the easier words first and then more and more difficult words show up as the user succeeds to guess correctly.
3. Add a function that makes it possible to refresh a word only when there's 1 chance left and not from the very beginning.

### Accessibility

I have tried during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML, like main, header, footer elements.
* Using a hover state on all buttons to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a letter or a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* I looked into red/green colour blindness. I used the chrome extension [Web Disability Simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla) to be able to see what someone with red/green colour blindness would see.

## Credits

### Code Used

* The basic code for building the game was inspired by the following tutorial which I then adapted for my own game. - [Word Scramble Game in HTML CSS & JavaScript](https://www.codingnepalweb.com/word-scramble-game-html-javascript/) by CodingNepal.

### Content

* All the text content was written by myself. 
* I got help from [chatgpt](chat.openai.com/) and [Phind ](https://www.phind.com/) to generate a list of words that are of greek origin and are often used in English.

### Media

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) were used for the cat images.

### Acknowledgments

* Jubril Akolade - My Code Institute Mentor.

* The Tutor support from Code Institute for assisting and explaining.

* My fellow co-student [Efi](https://github.com/EfthymiaKakoulidou) for giving me feedback and reviewing my project.
